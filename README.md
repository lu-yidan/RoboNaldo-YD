RoboNaldo trains Unitree G1 soccer-shooting policies in Isaac Lab.

This repository contains the simulation training code. For real-world hardware
deployment, export the trained policy to ONNX and use it with
[Deploy Repo](https://github.com/OpenDriveLab/RoboNaldo_Deploy/tree/f60f24459aaabc3aea9187a2b13f8923049b629c).

## Repository Overview

- `source/whole_body_tracking/`: Isaac Lab extension, G1 robot config, tracking task, rewards, observations, commands, and PPO config.
- `source/whole_body_tracking/whole_body_tracking/tasks/tracking/yaml/`: public right-foot task presets.
- `scripts/rsl_rl/`: direct train, play, and evaluation entrypoints.
- `docs/`: detailed setup, task-parameter, and reward references.

## News

- `2026-06` Training and deployment code release.

## Getting Started

### 1. Install Isaac Lab

Install Isaac Sim and Isaac Lab first. This codebase follows the Isaac Lab
extension layout and is intended for the Isaac Lab Python environment.

Original upstream baseline (Isaac Sim 4.5.0 / Isaac Lab 2.1.0 / Python 3.10)
also works. The stack this fork is currently developed and validated on:

| Dependency | Version |
| --- | --- |
| Isaac Sim | 5.1.0 (pip `isaacsim[all,extscache]`) |
| Isaac Lab | 2.3.2 |
| Python | 3.11 |
| PyTorch | 2.7.0+cu128 |
| rsl-rl-lib | 3.1.2 (must match Isaac Lab's pin) |

> The Isaac Sim 5.1 + Isaac Lab 2.3 native install has a few dependency
> ordering pitfalls (torch pin, `flatdict`/`setuptools`, `rsl-rl-lib` version).
> See `ADAM_KICK_HANDOFF.md` §3 for the exact, reproducible recipe.

### 2. Install BeyondMimic

Install the upstream
[BeyondMimic repository](https://github.com/HybridRobotics/whole_body_tracking)
first in the same Isaac Lab Python environment:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/HybridRobotics/whole_body_tracking.git
cd whole_body_tracking
python -m pip install -e .
```

Then return to this repository before installing the RoboNaldo extension.

### 3. Install This Extension

From the repository root:

```bash
python -m pip install -e source/whole_body_tracking
```

### 4. Download Robot Assets

The Unitree G1 description is not committed to this repository. Download it
before creating the environment from the same asset source used by BeyondMimic:

```bash
mkdir -p assets
curl -L -o unitree_description.tar.gz https://storage.googleapis.com/qiayuanl_robot_descriptions/unitree_description.tar.gz
tar -xzf unitree_description.tar.gz -C assets/
rm unitree_description.tar.gz
test -f assets/unitree_description/urdf/g1/main.urdf
```

The code resolves this path through `whole_body_tracking/assets.py`, where
`ASSET_DIR` points to the repo-level `assets/` directory (`parents[3]/"assets"`).
Robot descriptions live there (`unitree_description/`, and for this fork
`pnd_description/` for Adam). The soccer ball is created with Isaac Lab native
`SphereCfg`, so no separate ball mesh is required.

### 5. Prepare Motions and Checkpoints

Training requires one retargeted kick motion in RoboNaldo NPZ format. This
repository includes the open-source right-foot kick reference CSV retargeted by
GVHMR+GMR:

```text
motions/right_kick_reference.csv
```

You can replace it with your own motion. The included CSV has 612 frames at
50 Hz. Each row follows the `csv_to_npz.py` input layout: root position, root
quaternion in `xyzw`, then 29 Unitree G1 joint positions.

| Item | How it is used |
| --- | --- |
| Reference CSV | committed at `motions/right_kick_reference.csv` |
| Converted motion NPZ | local file under `motions/` or WandB registry artifact |
| Saved task preset | archived as expanded `params/task_params.yaml` in each run |
| Checkpoint | local `model_*.pt` or WandB run path via `--wandb_path` |

Convert the included reference CSV into NPZ:

```bash
python scripts/csv_to_npz.py \
  --input_file motions/right_kick_reference.csv \
  --input_fps 50 \
  --output_name right_kick \
  --headless
```

Optional: upload the converted NPZ to a W&B registry:

```bash
python scripts/upload_npz.py \
  --artifact_path motions/right_kick.npz \
  --entity <entity> \
  --name right_kick
```

## Training

RoboNaldo uses a staged curriculum. Continue each stage from the previous stage
checkpoint. Train the tracking prior on a plane first; after it tracks reliably,
optionally fine-tune that checkpoint with the mixed-terrain tracking preset for
robustness.

| Stage | Purpose | Right-foot preset |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Stage 1a | Plane motion-tracking prior, no task reward | `right_kick/tracking_params.yaml` |
| Stage 1b, optional | Mixed-terrain tracking robustness fine-tune | `right_kick/tracking_mixed_params.yaml` |
| Stage 2a | Small-range static-ball adaptation | `right_kick/task_params_1.yaml` |
| Stage 2b | Wider stationary-ball shooting | `right_kick/task_params_2.yaml` |
| Stage 3 | Dynamic incoming-ball shooting with jump trigger/adaptive sampling | `right_kick/task_params_3.yaml` |

For training, use `scripts/rsl_rl/train.py` directly:

```bash
python scripts/rsl_rl/train.py \
  --task Tracking-Body-Frame-Flat-G1-v0 \
  --motion_file motions/right_kick.npz \
  --yaml right_kick/tracking_params.yaml \
  --headless \
  --logger wandb \
  --log_project_name kick \
  --run_name right_kick_tracking
```

Use `--registry_name <entity>/wandb-registry-motions/right_kick:latest` instead
of `--motion_file` if you keep motions in a W&B artifact registry. For different
stages, change the `--yaml` argument value to switch among presets.

Resume training:

```bash
python scripts/rsl_rl/train.py \
  --task Tracking-Body-Frame-Flat-G1-v0 \
  --motion_file motions/right_kick.npz \
  --yaml <yaml_file> \
  --resume True \
  --load_run <plane_tracking_run_folder> \
  --checkpoint model_<iter>.pt \
  --headless
```

It is recommended to use a small policy noise std for Stage 2 and Stage 3
resume runs, so the task policy does not destroy the learned kick prior with
excessive exploration.

This release ships right-foot presets and the right-foot reference motion. A
left-foot curriculum should use mirrored motion data and change
`main_foot_name` to `left_ankle_roll_link`.

Use `Tracking-Body-Frame-Flat-G1-v0` registry for the paper-style body-frame
observation setup and `Tracking-Flat-G1-v0` for external-mocap-style global
observation setup.

## Play and Evaluation

Use `scripts/rsl_rl/play.py` for playback. Known Stage-2 hot-test run:

```bash
python scripts/rsl_rl/play.py \
  --task Tracking-Body-Frame-Flat-G1-v0 \
  --wandb_path <your_checkpoint_path> \
  --yaml right_kick/task_params_2.yaml \
  --motion_file motions/right_kick.npz \
  --num_envs 1 \
  --headless
```

Use `scripts/rsl_rl/eval.py` for evaluation:

```bash
python scripts/rsl_rl/eval.py \
  --task Tracking-Body-Frame-Flat-G1-v0 \
  --wandb_path <your_checkpoint_path> \
  --yaml <your_yaml_file> \
  --motion_file motions/right_kick.npz \
  --num_envs 6000 \
  --headless
```

`eval.py` writes per-episode shot metrics and aggregate accuracy/speed summaries
under `logs/rsl_rl/eval/`.

## Deployment (ONNX Export)

Real-robot deployment expects an ONNX policy from this repo. The exporter writes
`policy-obs.onnx` with embedded metadata (joint names, PD gains, default poses,
observation/action layout, and motion anchor settings) for
[RoboNaldo_Deploy](https://github.com/OpenDriveLab/RoboNaldo_Deploy/tree/f60f24459aaabc3aea9187a2b13f8923049b629c).

| When | Output |
| --- | --- |
| W&B training (`--logger wandb`) | `<run_folder>/<run_name>.onnx` next to each saved `model_*.pt` |
| `play.py` playback | `<checkpoint_folder>/exported/policy-obs.onnx` |

Run `play.py` once on the checkpoint you plan to deploy (same `--task`, `--yaml`,
and `--motion_file` as training) to generate the ONNX artifact. Use the Stage-2
or Stage-3 task preset for shooting policies. Keep checkpoint paths and run IDs
generic in public docs; deployment should consume the exported ONNX artifact
rather than relying on a private checkpoint reference.
